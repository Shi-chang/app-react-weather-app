# About the app
This is a weather application based on React. 
Every time the user inputs a city name and clicks the search button, the app will send a request to https://openweathermap.org/ with the city name and the developer's apikey to fetch response data containing the weather information of the city provided. It then parses the response data, retrieves useful information including weather condition and temperatures, and updates the weather information on the container.
Besidse, every time the user searches for the weather condition of a city, a random picture with the theme of 'nature' from https://source.unsplash.com is generated as the background for the app.
